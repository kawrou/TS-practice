# Type Aliases

Type Aliases are another way to create custom types similar to interfaces. 

The main difference between type aliases and interfaces is that type aliases are used to create new names for existing types, whereas interfaces are used to define the shape and behaviour of an object. 

Type Aliases are best used when you want to create more descriptive names for existing types or to create resueable types. They are also useful for simplifying complex types. 

Interfaces are best used when you want to define the shape and behavior of an object.

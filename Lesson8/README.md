# Interfaces

Interfaces in TS are a way for us to define a certain structure that other data structures can adhere to. In a way, it lets us define a Type. 

Perhaps we want to create objects and we know what properties that object requires. We can create an interface to ensure that the objects will always get the correct values for those properties. 

Another example is that we know we want an array of objects. By defining an interface, we can ensure that the array only accepts that specific Type of object. Anything else will throw an error.

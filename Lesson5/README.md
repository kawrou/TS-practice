# Functions and Types

You can specify the types of args passed to functions as well as the return value of the function. 
This is useful for enforcing correct types of args passed to functions and avoiding unexpected errors. 
You can also enforce the return type, otherwise TS will infer based on what you've written as the return value.
If you already know the type of the return value and want to enforce it then it can be useful to specify it.

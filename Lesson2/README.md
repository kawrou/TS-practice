#Installing & Compiling TS

Install:
- npm install typescript --save-dev 
- (This is for per-project basis rather than global)

Compiling:
Typescript needs to be compiled into vanilla JS before it can be ran. Though there are packages you can install to let you run it without you having to manually compile each time. 
- npx tsc index.ts

The command compiles the file into "index.js" which you can run with node.

# Any Type

Assigning the 'any' type to varibles, args, values, etc. is telling TS that it's type is non specific or change. 
This sort of defeats the purpose of using TS but it can be useful for when migrating JS to TS. 
Perhaps you don't know what the data type is yet. But generally it's better to specifiy the type and not use 'any'.
